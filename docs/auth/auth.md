1. **Authentication**
  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource.

  **401 Unauthorized**: 
  The user's identity could not be verified, typically because the user hasn't provided valid credentials (e.g., username/password) or a valid authentication token.
2. **Authorization**
  Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or entity has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a certain action within a system.
  **403 Forbidden:** The user is authenticated but doesn't have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
