# Migration
In the context of relational database management systems (RDBMS), migrations refer to a set of scripts or procedures used to manage changes to the database schema over time. These changes can include adding new tables, modifying existing tables (e.g., adding or removing columns), changing data types, or creating indexes and constraints.

Migrations are essential for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the database schema, especially in applications where the database evolves over time due to new features, bug fixes, or other requirements.

Here are some key aspects of migrations in RDBMS:

Schema Evolution: Migrations enable developers to evolve the database schema incrementally as the application evolves. Each migration represents a specific change to the schema, allowing for versioning and tracking of database changes.

Reproducibility: Migrations are typically written as scripts or code files that can be executed in a repeatable manner. This ensures that database changes can be applied consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Version Control: Migrations are often stored alongside application code in version control systems (e.g., Git). This allows developers to track changes to the database schema over time, review historical changes, and collaborate effectively with team members.

Rollback: Migrations should be reversible, meaning they can be rolled back or undone if necessary. This capability allows developers to revert changes in case of errors or unexpected issues during deployment.

Dependency Management: Migrations can have dependencies on each other, meaning that certain migrations must be applied before others. Proper management of dependencies ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order, avoiding conflicts and ensuring data consistency.

Popular frameworks and tools, such as Django ORM for Python, Ruby on Rails, Laravel's Eloquent ORM for PHP, and Prisma for Node.js, provide built-in support for database migrations. These tools automate many aspects of migration management, making it easier for developers to maintain and evolve database schemas alongside their applications.
